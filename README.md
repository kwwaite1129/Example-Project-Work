### Volunteer Tax Return Project
This is one of the first projects I worked on in my Master's program. I wanted to understand if a person's adjusted gross income play a factor in whether they will have their taxes done by a volunteer in North Carolina? I also looked at additional variables to see if there were any trends in volunteer prepared returns and the people who are more likely to use this service including the number of dependents for tax filer, city, farm returns, and student filers.
