# Example-Project-Work
This repository contains examples of Data Science Projects I have worked on throughout my time in my graduate program.

### Volunteer Tax Return Project
This is one of the first projects I worked on in my Master's program. I wanted to understand if a person's adjusted gross income play a factor in whether they will have their taxes done by a volunteer in North Carolina? I also looked at additional variables to see if there were any trends in volunteer prepared returns and the people who are more likely to use this service including the number of dependents for tax filer, city, farm returns, and student filers.

### North Carolina School District Grades Project
For this project, I mainly performed various data wrangling and munging tasks to merge data from various sources(csv files, web scraping, JSON, SQL, etc.) into one central data file for analysis. I did not have to do any analysis or modeling for this project. It was stricyly about gathering data from various sources using Python code.
